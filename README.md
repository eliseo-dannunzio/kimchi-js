**What is kimchi?**

Kimchi (김치) is a yummy traditional fermented Korean side dish, made of vegetables with a variety of seasonings. In traditional preparation, kimchi was stored underground in jars to keep cool during the summer months and unfrozen during the winter months. There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made from napa cabbage, radish, scallion, or cucumber as a main ingredient.

**So, what's kimchi.js then...?**

Kimchi.js is a JavaScript library used for the dsplay of Korean Unicode on modern day browsers. It allows the display of Romanized Korean text, but in the event that JavaScript is available to the browser, the text can be converted to Korean Unicode on said browser. This means that you have a shim of sorts that would still work in conveying your message whether the browser's JavaScript was turned off or on. Cool, huh?
